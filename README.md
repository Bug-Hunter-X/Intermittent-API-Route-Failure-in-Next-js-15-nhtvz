# Intermittent API Route Failure in Next.js 15

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15 where API routes intermittently fail to respond correctly to client-side fetch requests.  The API route itself returns a 200 status, but the client-side code does not receive the expected data.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the behavior of the `/` route.  You may need to refresh the page multiple times to observe the failure.

## Potential Causes

The root cause of this issue is unclear.  Possible causes include:

* **Caching issues:**  Aggressive caching on the server or client may be interfering with the response delivery.
* **Race conditions:** A race condition may be occurring between the server-side response and the client-side fetch request.
* **Next.js bug:** There's a possibility this is a bug within Next.js itself.

## Solution

This issue was resolved by adding a simple delay to the client-side fetch call to improve the timing. This ensures that the API route has sufficient time to complete and return the response before the fetch call completes. Further investigation might reveal a more robust solution.
